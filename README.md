<h1>About and Getting Started</h1>
- This repository provides code for a project aimed at using parallel processing techniques to accelerate data processing workloads. For data processing, MATLAB is used, and Git is used for version control.

- To get started with this project, you will need to have MATLAB and Git installed on your computer.

- The project consists of several MATLAB scripts and functions that implement parallel processing techniques to speed up data processing tasks.

- To run the project, open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory. Run the main MATLAB script to execute the code.
